##Introduction

This is a slightly modified copy of the [Location REST API](https://github.com/ddewaele/location-rest-api) that I used for the [Ember.JS CRUD Demo webapp](https://github.com/ddewaele/emberjs-crud-rest/).

It is used here as the REST backend for the EmberJS Todo MVC sample app.

Code for the EmberJS Todo MVC sample app is included in this repo but is based on the EmberJS sample from [the official TodoMvc Git repository](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)

Instructions on how to start the API can be found in [Location REST API](https://github.com/ddewaele/location-rest-api)
